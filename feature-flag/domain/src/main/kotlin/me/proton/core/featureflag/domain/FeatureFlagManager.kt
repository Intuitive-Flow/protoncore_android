 * that will be needed during the lifecycle. This will help ensuring that the flags' values are always
 * up-to-date with remote while avoiding to perform an API call to each time we need a flag.
 *
 * Clients should take care of implementing some logic to use default values when it wasn't possible to
 * receive them through this repo.
