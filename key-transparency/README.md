# Key transparency

This is the implementation of key transparency
for all android clients using proton address keys.

## What is key transparency

Key transparency (KT) is a project to solve a security issue
of the key management set up at proton.
Without KT, clients will fetch public keys for other users 
from the server, and have no other choices than to trust those keys
if the user has not done an out of band verification.
This means that the server can do a man-in-the-middle attack on an exchange between proton users,
by serving a fake public key for which it has a private key, and reencrypting
the message to the real public key of the recipient.

## How does it work (briefly)

Each proton address is associated with a signed key list (SKL) generated by the client, a list 
of all the address keys that the client can decrypt, signed with the primary address key.
The server periodically computes a merkle tree (an efficient structure to check a set membership)
over all the SKLs of all addresses of proton users.
It publishes the root of the merkle tree, by generating a TLS certificate that includes
that root, using a 3rd party certificate authority.
This periodical publication is called an Epoch, and each epoch is identified by an increasing
Epoch ID.
This certificate is logged by a "Certificate transparency" authority, to ensure 
proton doesn't generate multiple versions of an epoch.
Now, to ensure that the server does not cheat when serving keys, the 
server is held accountable by two kind of external parties:
- External auditors
- Each proton user, using a client that runs the KT client checks.

External auditors will go through each epoch, recompute the merkle tree 
from scratch to check the computation was done correctly. And will go
through the logs of certificate transparency, to ensure only a single 
version of an epoch was published with a certificate.

Proton clients will make KT checks in three occasions:
- Periodically, the client runs a self audit: it verifies that the user's own address keys are correctly included in the current epoch.
- When fetching the keys from an other user, the client verifies that the keys returned by the server are correctly included in the current epoch.
- When modifying, removing or generating new keys, the client records the modification, and later verifies that the modification was reflected in the new epoch.

## How it is implemented:

### Dependencies:

The implementation depends on a custom golang library, which is built and
bundled with the golang build for crypto library, see the "gopenpgp" module.

### Self audit
- Self audit is implemented in the [SelfAudit](domain/src/main/kotlin/me/proton/core/keytransparency/domain/usecase/SelfAudit.kt) usecase. It should be called through 
- Each user address is verified by the [AuditUserAddress](domain/src/main/kotlin/me/proton/core/keytransparency/domain/usecase/AuditUserAddress.kt) usecase.
- Past key modifications are stored in the local db as [AddressChangeEntity.kt](data/src/main/kotlin/me/proton/core/keytransparency/data/local/entity/AddressChangeEntity.kt)
and are checked by the [VerifyAddressChangeWasIncluded](domain/src/main/kotlin/me/proton/core/keytransparency/domain/usecase/VerifyAddressChangeWasIncluded.kt) usecase.

## Using the module:

- Self audit should be run through [RunSelfAudit](domain/src/main/kotlin/me/proton/core/keytransparency/domain/RunSelfAudit.kt)
or through the worker, the module provides a periodic worker [SelfAuditWorker](data/src/main/kotlin/me/proton/core/keytransparency/data/SelfAuditWorker.kt) and 
a [SelfAuditStarter](data/src/main/kotlin/me/proton/core/keytransparency/data/SelfAuditStarter.kt) to schedule a worker for each active user logged in the app.
The worker can be scheduled via the [KeyTransparencyInitializer](presentation/src/main/java/me/proton/core/keytransparency/presentation/init/KeyTransparencyInitializer.kt).
- The product needs to provide a db that satisfies the [KeyTransparencyDatabase](data/src/main/kotlin/me/proton/core/keytransparency/data/local/KeyTransparencyDatabase.kt) interface.
- The product needs to provide an instance of [KeyTransparencyConfig](domain/src/main/kotlin/me/proton/core/keytransparency/domain/KeyTransparencyConfig.kt).
The config contains a local feature flag to enable/disable the checks globally. If the product wants to
enable KT, it needs to provide an instance of [KeyTransparencyParameters](domain/src/main/kotlin/me/proton/core/keytransparency/domain/KeyTransparencyConfig.kt),
the module provides several instances, for each environment that supports KT on the backend.
